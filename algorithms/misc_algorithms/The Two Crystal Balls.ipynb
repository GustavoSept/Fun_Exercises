    "You have two identical crystal balls and a building with \"n\" floors. One of the floors in the building is the highest floor from which a ball can be dropped without breaking. You need to determine this floor using the fewest possible drops.\n",

    "\t• If a ball is dropped from a floor higher than the breaking point, it will break.\n",
    "\t• If a ball is dropped from a floor lower than or equal to the breaking point, it will not break."
